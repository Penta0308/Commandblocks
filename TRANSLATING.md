# Translations
If you like the mod and would like to play it in your native language, you can translate it by creating a new bundle file (refer to modding wiki for the tag of your country). If there are translation errors, you can fix them by editing the bundle file.   

## Bundle-lib
The mod uses bundle-lib, a script which allows to change mod name and description in mods tab in terms of language. You can modify them by adding `"mod.commandblocks.name ="` and `"mod.commandblocks.description ="` in the bundle.   

Thank you very much!
